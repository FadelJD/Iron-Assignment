# Iron-Assignment

This assignment was performed using VB.NET at first (Module1.vb) and then later converted the code to C# (Program.cs). The IDE that was used to test the solutions was Visual Studio 2019, and it would be recommended to use a similar IDE or online tool for debugging. The implementation is explained in the implementation.txt file.
